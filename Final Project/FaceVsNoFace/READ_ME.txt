      The files that are within this folder allows a user to detect whehter there is a face in images. This code will be able to take in a set of images of two
    classes (Face or No Face) and then train based on those classes. Once the training is completed the model will be able to detect whehter a face has been
    detected in the image. The user will need to change the dataset directory path in order to use their custom dataset along with changing the target classes.
