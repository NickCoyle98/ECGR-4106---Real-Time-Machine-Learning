    The files within this folder allows a user to detect facial features of a thermal image. The code will be able to take in a data set of images, augment those
  images and then creating a bounding box for the features on a face. In order for a user to use this code the directories within the data loaders need to be 
  changed along with the target classes. Once this has been complete then the user can begin to train the model to detect facial features of whatever image
  data set is chosen. The code as is specifically is to be used for detection features of a face. This code shows the user the test outputs of the images 
  and then the Intersection of Union of those images.
